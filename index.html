    <h2><a href="about.html">About Us</a></h2>
    <p>Lemuria is a small island off of the West North American coast, discovered by the famed explorer Howard Philips.</p>
    <p>Long thought but a legend, the island was uninhabited; however, there were the ruins of a great civilization on its surface. Scraps of ancient texts named these cities, and other more modern cities were built near them.</p>
